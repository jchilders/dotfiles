# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v
bind v split-window -h

# move around panes with j and k, a bit like vim
# as of tmux 1.1, there is no way to move based on pane position (ie, no way to
# move the pane to the right)
#bind j down-pane
#bind k up-pane

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# This configuration file binds many of the common GNU screen key bindings to
# appropriate tmux key bindings. Note that for some key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue and also that this set omits binding some commands available in
# tmux but not in screen.
#
# Note this is only a selection of key bindings and they are in addition to the
# normal tmux key bindings. This is intended as an example not as to be used
# as-is.
